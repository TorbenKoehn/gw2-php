# Daily Achievements

/achievements/daily are bugged for EU and will get an end-point breaking fix soon

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:2/achievements/daily


# Build

Uninteresting right now, but will be in for completion

# Commerce

Completely. Really.

# Continents, Floors, Maps

Completely.

# Emblem

Will rather wait for Guilds right now

# Guilds

Are only available in v1 right now. We get them from v1. Waiting for v2.
Through that it mixes up the retrieving style a bit.

You can't fetch all guilds at once.
You can't fetch paged guilds.
You can't fetch multiple guilds at once.
You can't fetch an ID index.

Only one guild at once, knowing the exact ID.

$api->getGuild($id) does that.

# Floors, Maps

Will be merged into /continents, we already got support for that kind of API style through Child-EntitySets 

# Items

Only ID, Name and Icon are supported right now, we need to add all other fields and sub-infos

# Materials

Account-Materials are supported, but you can get the Material-Categories via just /materials

# PvP

Completely.

# WvW

Completely.

# Recipes

Completely.

# Quaggans

Just a gimmick, but will be in for completion.
